      "3. **Emotional Intelligence**: Emotional intelligence is crucial in any relationship. Look for someone who can manage their emotions, empathize with yours, and be supportive during difficult times.\n",
      "4. **Independence**: A healthy relationship allows for individuality and independence. Ensure your partner values their own interests, hobbies, and friendships outside of the relationship.\n",

      "6. **Similar Interests**: Sharing common interests and hobbies can create a strong bond between partners. Look for someone who shares your passions or is willing to explore new ones with you.\n",
      "7. **Trustworthiness**: Trust is essential in any relationship. Ensure your partner is reliable, honest, and transparent in their words and actions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Additionally, consider the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Red flags**: Be aware of potential red flags, such as dishonesty, manipulation, or a lack of emotional intelligence.\n",
